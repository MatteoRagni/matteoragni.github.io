                        I'm a very passionate engineer, and I always wanted to study in the field of applied mechatronics engineering and artificial
                        intelligence. I finished my PhD degree and I started a post-doc where I'm working on high performance control of wet clutches for off-highway transmissions.

                                <p>We propose a hybrid adaptive feed-forward regulator for single input single output linear plants with a full relative
                                degree. The scheme includes an adaptive law that estimates the inverse of the plant and provides a feed-forward control
                                calculated on the basis of the desired output and its derivatives.</p>
                                
                                <p>The adaptation is performed during discrete time events, called jumps, while the feed-forward action is continuous.
                                This combination leads to a full hybrid system.</p>
                                
                                <p>The advantage of this framework is a conceptual separation between the adaptation dynamics, which is discrete, and the

                                <p>Under an assumption of a persistence of excitation, we show through examples that the output asymptotically tracks the

                                <p>In manufacturing applications, process preparation is a time consuming and an error prone
                                    operation, and costs are especially relevant when dealing with small batches.</p>

                                <p>One mandatory operation for machining preparation is the raw material alignment with respect
                                    to machine reference frame, commonly done through an electronic touching probe. Machine
                                    manufacturers implement in-controller preparatory codes for the identification of a range
                                    of geometric features (simple contacts, plane normals, circles, etc.) in order to make
                                    alignments faster, but those procedures rely on human-input parameters, and an error
                                    may have catastrophic consequences for the probe itself.</p>

                                <p>ARTool Zero supports the operators in programming touching probe trajectories, generating
                                    and simulating on-the-fly the part-program that guides the probe in the identification
                                    of a geometric features. The interface of ARTool Zero is an augmented reality application
                                    based on the ARTool Framework. The application runs on a mobile device that communicates
                                    with the machine controller. ARTool Zero projects coordinates from the mobile device
                                    screen to the machine active reference frame through the means of markers. One of the
                                    markers acts as an anchor for a virtual plane, i.e. the plane in the real world on which
                                    the mobile screen coordinates are projected, allowing to convert a 2D screen tap in a
                                    3D point in space.</p>

                                <p>Ego-localization accuracy is one of the critical aspects of the application, thus the validation
                                    of the core ARTool library is discussed. A video that presents the application in a real-case
                                    scenario is available on

                                    The GTOC9 competition requires the design of a sequence of missions to remove debris from the LEO orbit. A mission is a sequence
                                    of transfer of the spacecraft from one debris to another. Both missions and transfer
                                    must fulfill a set of constraints. The work presents the procedures to develop a solution
                                    for the GTOC9 problem (i.e the mission sequence) that does not violate constraints.
                                    <p></p>
                                    The solution is obtained through an evolutionary algorithm that combines pre-computed basic missions stored in a database.
                                    The main objective of the algorithm is to minimize the overall cost of the solution,
                                    in order to maximize the competition score. The database of pre-computed missions is
                                    derived by connecting transfers stored in a database of transfers, through a combinatorial
                                    approach that considers the problem constraints. The database of transfer is formulated
                                    through the solution of a constrained minimization problem upon the control action (the
                                    magnitude of the overall impulsive velocity changes ΔV ). Only a subset of all possible
                                    transfers (selected on the basis of acceptable ΔV ), enters in the database.

                                    structures. The available tools, based on a deterministic approach, seem to fail in the
                                    solution of the general case.</p>

                                <p>The fast development GPU-based computing has revived the interest in general approximator
                                    based upon machine learning approach. Fast training algorithms, developed for massively
                                    parallel consumer GPUs, have brought the complexity of deep multi-layer perceptron to
                                    desktop computing and embedded systems. As a consequence, the applications of neural
                                    networks to solve the most diverse tasks has exploded in the last few years.</p>

                                <p>In the recent past, the applications of machine learning in crystallography have been limited
                                    to the formulation of clustering and principal component analysis approaches to datasets,
                                    but did not massively capture the interest of the community. We will show here that an
                                    approximator, trained on a dataset that allow to sufficiently generalize a problem, can
                                    help in solving some of the toughest challenges.</p>

                                <p>In particular, the problems of classification of diffraction data, of identification of the
                                    phases in a mixture or of structure solution (phasing), can be expressed with a machine
                                    learning approach and a neural network can be trained to not only answer to a specific
                                    query, but also to express the confidence on such classification. Albeit still in its
                                    infancy, the approach has the potential to have a deep impact in the field and largely
                                    extend the current state of the art. Theory and applications will be provided.</p>

                                    <b>Aim</b>: Machine-learning technologies like Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) can help to
                                    estimate physiological variables that typically require exotic hardware. For instance,
                                    direct measurement of oxygen uptake (VO

                                    </small>) is practically unattainable during outdoor cycling exercise. Using an Artificial Intelligence
                                    approach, the aim of our project was to predict VO

                                    <b>Methods</b>: An MLP was used as the classifier composed of 5 fully connected layers built
                                    to predict the probability for VO2 to fall into different intensity levels (or classes).
                                    Five common classes (zones) used in the design of training programs were defined, with
                                    one additional class added for appropriate analysis (0-45%VO

                                    </small>), totalling 6 classes. The dataset was formed from data collected on amateur cyclists
                                    asked to follow pseudorandom cycling on an ergometer in the laboratory. The dataset was
                                    split into a training set (that typically used in training), a validation set (that used
                                    to tune hyper-parameters) and a test set (used to assess accuracy).

                                    <b>Results</b>: The performance of the MLP on the test set reached 78% for the single run.
                                    The main uncertainties of the predictor were in the upper level of VO

                                    noise. Moreover, these two classes did not show a balanced representation in the training
                                    set, as such exercise intensities that elicit high VO

                                    </small> are less sustainable, and more variable, above critical power. Conclusion: Despite modest
                                    levels of accuracy, this AI methodology holds potential to be refined and used for future

                                <p>When we approach shape representation, we need to choose which modeling constructs to adopt,
                                    e.g., low-level geometric elements like edges and (sur)faces, or more general elements
                                    like protrusions, bumps and holes, among others. The latter can be described as spatial
                                    configurations of the former satisfying unity and, possibly, identity criteria. However,
                                    once these are brought into the picture, we need to understand what they are, how they
                                    relate to their shape, as well as how complex shapes result from the combination of simpler

                                    Recently, many studies have investigated the role of individual and cognitive differences during Web navigation and Web searching.
                                    Despite this interest, no works have considered the role may assume individual differences
                                    in real-environment navigation during Web navigation. The aim of this work is to investigate
                                    the effect of different spatial cognitive styles: Landmark style (LS), Route style (RS)
                                    and Survey style (SS), on Web searching behaviour. In real-environment navigation, having
                                    a specific style determines the type of information individuals selected to navigate
                                    and orient themselves. We hypothesize that LS individuals are less proficient during
                                    Web exploration due to their analytical analysis of the environmental features. Vice
                                    versa SS individuals will show high performance on Web exploration for their holistic

                                    We asked 30 College Students (10 LS, 10 RS, 10 SS) to solve three Web information tasks. The spatial cognitive style of participants
                                    was assessed through the Spatial Cognitive Style Test, and they were also asked to fill
                                    in a questionnaire about their internet and computer use. An ad hoc key-logger program
                                    for browsers was used to collect Web behaviour measures. In particular, the measures
                                    considered were: search engine tools used (e.g. back button), pages visited and revisited,
                                    time spent on information searching, and mouse cursor movements.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The results showed significant differences between the spatial cognitive styles: LS seems to use a trial and error strategy
                                    in order to obtain the relevant information. Differences also emerged in the distribution
                                    of mouse cursor movements during Web navigation.

                                    In manufacturing applications, setup and part-program verification on CNC machine tools is a time-consuming and error-prone
                                    operation, whose costs are especially relevant when dealing with small batches, custom
                                    components, and large/complex shapes. This paper presents an Augmented Reality application
                                    aimed at supporting machine tool operators in setting up the machining process, simplifying
                                    and quickening the iden-tification of setup errors and misalignments.

                                    The paper firstly discusses the system architecture and its implementation, then presents a set of benchmark tests assessing
                                    system accuracy and reliability in ego-localization against an open-source AR library
                                    and an optical multistereoscopic motion capture ground-truth. Finally, the effectiveness
                                    of the proposed solution on the typical part-program setup workflow is assessed by comparison
                                    with a standard in-air part-program execution and evaluated by means of a NASA TLX test

                                    The key task performed by CNCs is the generation of the time sequence of set points for driving each physical axis of the
                                    machine tool during program execution. This interpolation of axes movement must satisfy
                                    a number of constraints on axes dynamics (velocity, acceleration, and jerk), and on process
                                    outcome (smooth tool movement and precise tracking of the nominal tool path at the desired
                                    feed rate). This paper presents an algorithm that aims at solving the axes interpolation
                                    problem by exploiting an optimal control problem formulation. Unlike other solutions
                                    proposed in the literature, the approach presented here employs an original approach
                                    by assuming a predefined path tracking tolerance—to be added to the constraints listed
                                    earlier—and calculating the entire trajectory (path and feed rate profile) that satisfies
                                    the given constraints.

                                    The proposed solution is used for preprocessing a milling part program and redefining the sequence of positioning commands
                                    to cope with the solution of the OC problem. The new part program is then executed by
                                    a state-of-the-art industrial CNC, and the effectiveness in reducing execution time and
                                    axes accelerations is experimentally tested and reported.

                                    Starting from the basic paradigm of perception-action, an avionic system for an UAV aimed at avalanche rescue is derived
                                    as autonomous agent. Using last advances in cognitive science, situatedness and embodiment
                                    for the agent are analyzed, and exploited to reach the mission goal. Part of the searching
                                    algorithm is introduced as one of the complex behaviors in which the agent must decide
                                    between different intents.

                                    A stacked layers architecture is presented. At the lower levels, algorithms run for stabilization and obstacles avoidance;
                                    those ensure drone's survival. Upper layer provides an estimation of orientation over
                                    ground and generates a reference in such a way that ARTVA signal is maximized, while
                                    safety for rescuers is ensured. Highest layers are reserved for searching routines. It
                                    is well known that pinpointing a victim - due to the particular shape of near-field transmitting
                                    source - using ARTVA signal is a difficult task. In this paper we present a way for searching
                                    buried victims that differs from the one presented in literature, in which two routines
                                    works together in order to find the field origin. The first routine exploits gradient
                                    information to reach the highest signal strength location, while the second tries to
                                    identify a confidence region through an internal emulation of the field (optimization
                                    problem).

                                <p>
                                    When no beacons are detected the agent behavior changes and a search over a wider region is performed. So far, boundaries
                                    for the region are provided by an external agent, such as a rescuer. The switching between
                                    the two intent - i.e. scanning vs. active searching - is operated by an implementation
                                    of the radar detection algorithm.

                                    to cope with the solution of the OC problem. The new part program is then executed by
                                    a state-of-the-art industrial CNC, and the effectiveness in reducing execution time and
                                    axes accelerations is experimentally tested and reported.
